Collectible Game using Unreal Engine

This project was created using Unreal Engine. It showcases landscaping, a graphical health bar with a damage system, a self-updating collectibles system also with a graphical component, scene switches, and sound effects and music. 

After completing the Tech Academy's C++ and Unreal Engine Course of the Game Developer Bootcamp, I worked along side other students during a two-week Sprint to develop a full-scale game. I had free range to create virtually any game I wanted, which allowed for a lot of learning oportunities. Since the development was all done on an individual level, I developed the back-end and front-end aspects of the game. Through this project, I became comfortable using Unreal Engine and I am very excited to keep exploring the vast features it has to offer.


Below are descriptions of the features I made for my game, along with images of my blueprints and final product images.

<h3>Collectible System</h3>
 
The objective of the game is to collect all 30 orbs without dying. Upon collision, the orb is destroyed and the HUD reduces the total amount of orbs left by one. For added UI, a sound is played when the orb is collected.

<p id="HealthSystem">
<h3>Health System</h3>

The main obstacle in the game is the floating platforms that need to be traversed to move from one platform to another. If you fall, you may lose health. If there is damage, the health bar will change to reflect the lost health.


</p>
<p id="DamageSystem">
<h3>Damage System</h3>
The damage system is set up via time, so losing health is determined by how long the player is falling for. If the fall is over one second, the player will lose health at intervals of 25%. If the player dies, the game ends.

</p>
<p id="Scene Switches">    
<h3>Scene Switches</h3>

There are 3 scene switches. This includes a main menu scene to play the game, the game over scene when the player dies, and a scene for when the player is successful in collecting all 30 orbs. The main menu scene has a play button and a quit button. The game over and winning scenes have a retry button, a quit button, and a main menu button.

<p id="Other Skills">
<h3>Other Skills</h3>
<ul>
<li>Learning how to approach a project from almost the very beginning. I learned how to segment out a project into more digestible pieces that can realistically be completed versus looking at it just as a whole.</li>
<li>Experiencing a real world example of project management using Sprint and Agile Methodologies.</li>
<li>Exhausting all possible bug fixes that I could think of or find before asking for help. I wanted to not only try everything in my knowledge base before asking for help, but I wanted to challenge myself to solve a problem that I had not experienced before. </li>
<li>Being able to create and use my own artwork was also a fun experience.</li>
</ul>

Lastly, here are some images from the final product. All the artwork was self-made using Procreate.
